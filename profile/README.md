## About

Developed at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) from the University of Lisbon in the scope of Pedro Santos PhD thesis, under the supervision of Professor Paulo Oliveira. The first version of the prototype, including mechanical design, avionics hardware and software developement, and preliminary GNC algorithms, lead to the conclusion of two MSc thesis, by André Fonte and Pedro Martins.
